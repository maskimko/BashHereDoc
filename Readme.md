# BashHereDoc

This project is a very simple and tiny library for parsing bash-like (bourne-again shell) heredoc syntax.
Heredoc (Bash Here Documents) is bash built-in functionality. You can read more about it [here](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html)
Also this project includes a CLI executable to extract doc here contents.
